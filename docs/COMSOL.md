# Comsol in 18 Minutes Webinar
---
speaker: "Amelia Halliday"

##
Quick overview of COMSOL including some demonstartions and provide some insite to how e can use it.

**What is multiphysics?**
- Coupled physical phenomena in comptjer simulation
- the study of multiple interacting physical properties

Comsol multiphyiscs is a software for modleing multiphysics or single physics simulations

Same user interface no matter whay type of physics are being modeled. 

### Example: Termal actuaror
- Electric currents
- Heat transfer
- Solid mechanics

Model builder:
Model wizard provides guided approach or blank model gives us complete drsign. 

Select 3d and then the physics subset we want to use. 
"Joule heating and thermal expansion"
