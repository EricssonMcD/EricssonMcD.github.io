Title: "Getting Started With COMSOL Multi-Physics: The Modeling Workflow"
---

This lesson covers making a model, post processing and making an app from our model. This will be done through an introduction to the user interface and the "**COMSOL Modeling Workflow**.

The COMSOL modeling workflow consists of the following steps:
- Set UP Model Environment 
- Build Geometry w/ CAD or importing
- Create definition using parameters and variables
- Specify material properties through assignment to geometries
- Define physics using boundary conditions and constraints of the system
- Create Mesh using physics or user defined settings
- Run simulation using specific studies for relevant physics
- Post process Results
- Package model into simulation app *optional*

This workflow is consistent for all types of problems being solved. 

## Modeling Joule Heating in BUS bar.
Ohmic/resistive hearting: we pass an electric current through a metal which then heats up du to the resistance.
