# COMSOL in 18 Minutes Webinar
---
speaker: "Amelia Halliday"

##
Quick overview of COMSOL including some demonstrations and provide some incite to how we can use it.

**What is multi physics?**
- Coupled physical phenomena in computer simulation
- the study of multiple interacting physical properties

Comsol multi-physics is a software for modeling multi-physics or single physics simulations

Same user interface no matter what type of physics are being modeled. 

### Example: Thermal actuator
- Electric currents
- Heat transfer
- Solid mechanics

Model builder:
Model wizard provides guided approach or blank model gives us complete design. 

Select 3d and then the physics subset we want to use. 
"Joule heating and thermal expansion"
