**Staring with Faraday's Law in the Frequency domain, derive Helmholtz's equation for $\vec{E}$ defining all new quantities that you introduce (e.g.$\vec{k}$) and also any simplifying assumptions that you need to make to arrive at this equation.**

Helmholtz's equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \vec{E} + k^2 \vec{E} = 0
$$

## Solution:
