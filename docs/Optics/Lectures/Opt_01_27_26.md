Last Time we found the ABCD matrix for a ray traveling through free space with refractive index $n_1$. This was interesting but to develop more complext optical systems we need to find ways to mathematically treat differnt components of these sytems including:
- [1] A Free Space
- [2] A flat interface
- [3] A thin lense
- [4] A Curved Interface

## Free Space

As we leanred in class last time, if we want to find a new vector from an origional after travleing a distance, $d$, across a free space of refractive index $n$, we can use the matrix

$$
\bar{m} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \frac{d}{n_1} \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

To use this matrix, we can take our original vector, $\vec{f}_1$ and multiply by $\bar{m}$ to find $\vec{f}_2$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y_2 \\
n_2 u_2
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \frac{d}{n_1} \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
y_1 \\
n_1 u_1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Flat Interface
From here, it would be benefial to have a way to represent the interaction of our ray with a flat interface between a region with refractive index $n_1$ and $n_2$. Much like how we solved for our ABCD matrix last time, we will set up the equation

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y_2 \\
n_2 u_2
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
A y_1 + B n_1 u_1 \\
C y_1 + D n_1 u_1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

and then find other equations which connect $y_2$ and $n_2 u_2$ with $y_1$ and $n_1 u_1$ to find the coefficents. 

Going forward to solve this type of problem it is very useful to draw a diagram and look at the problem graphically. 

**Add Image**

In this graphic we can see that a vector $\vec{f}_1$ hits a flat interface and transitions to $\vec{f}_2$. In the blown up graphic, we see that the heigh of $y_2$ is equal to the height of $y_1$ immeditly to the left and right of the interface giving the equation 

$$y_2 = y_1 + 0(n_1u_1)$$

*The $0(n_1u_1)$ term will make more sense after evaluting the next optical component*

We know snells law to be 

$$n_1 \sin{\theta_1} = n_2 \sin{\theta_2}$$
using our paraxial approximation we know $\sin{\theta} = \theta$ and using the y nu terminology $\theta_n = u_n$ giving the equation

$$n_1 u_1 = 0(y_1) + n_2 u_2$$

Now we can look at our two equations with the expanded ABCD matrix and try to match coeffiences:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y_2 \\
n_2 u_2
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
A y_1 + B n_1 u_1 \\
C y_1 + D n_1 u_1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$y_2 = y_1 + 0(n_1u_1)$$

$$n_1 u_1 = 0(y_1) + n_2 u_2$$

From this we can see clearly that our coefficents will be $A=1$, $B=0$, $C=0$, $D=1$ giving the flat interface matrix:

$$
\bar{m} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
= \bar{I}
$$

## Thin Lense
The next optical component we will consider is that of a *thin lens*. This is an approximation that neglets the thickness of the lens itself and is essentially a plane that affects the incoming ray as if it were an actual lens. 

Like a traditional lense, the thin lens has a focal lenth $\mathcal{f}$ which is the same on both sides of the lens. 

When we say focal length we mean that when parallel rays (collimated light) enters the lense in optical space, those rays will all intersect at one point a distance $\mathcal{f}$ from the lens in image space. The inverse is also true, a point source in optics space will result in collimated light in image space (*see diagrams below*).

**Insert photos**

When using the thin lens approximation, we will draw negative and positive lenses in the following way to ensure we know we are making this approximation:

**Insert photos**

To figure out our ABCD matrix, we need both digrams we saw earlier (parallel source and point source). When we derive our ABCD matrix for a positive lens, it will also work for a negative lens. 

We will begin with looking at the parallel source.

**Image of parallel source with rays crossing in image space**

Our initial vector $\vec{f}_1$ can have an initial heigh with any $y_1$ becasue all parallel rays will fross at $\mathcal{f}$ in image space. We also know that the incoming light is all parallel which means it interacts orthogonally to the thin lens meaning $n_1 u_1 = 0$. Combing these we see

$$\vec{f_1} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
y_1 \\
n_1 u_1
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
y_1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}$$

Now, choosing an arbitrary $\vec{f}_1$ we can draw the right triangle with sides $y_1$ and $\mathcal{f}$. If we want to find $n_2 u_2$ we can use trigonometry and see that (using the paraxial approximation) $\tan{\theta_2} = \frac{y_1}{\mathcal{f}} \approx u_21$ we need this in terms of $n_2 u_2$ so we can multiply creatively by $` = \frac{n_2}{n_2}$ to get

$$\frac{y_1}{\mathcal{f}} = \frac{n_2 u_2}{n_2} \rightarrow n_2 u_2 = \frac{n_2}{\mathcal{f}}y_1$$
