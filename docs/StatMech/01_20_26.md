## Introduction to the course and beginning material

In this course we will mostly cover **statistical thermodynamics (equilibrium statistical mechanics)**. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics may be covered briefly towards the end of the course if time permits.

## Review of Quantum Mechanics

Before starting statistical mechanics, we review quantum mechanics. Thermodynamics will average quantum mechanical properties over a large number of atoms and provide mathematical relationships between QM and measurable properties.

### Postulates of QM

1. **State Function:** The state of a system is described by a wavefunction $\Psi(\vec{r},t)$ that depends on position and time.
2. **Observables:** To every classical observable, there corresponds a linear, Hermitian operator $\hat{A}$. The expectation value obeys
   $$
   \int f^* (\hat{A} g) \, d\tau = \int g^* (\hat{A} f) \, d\tau
   $$
3. **Measurement:** A measurement of $\hat{A}$ yields an eigenvalue $a$:
   $$
   \hat{A} \Psi = a \Psi
   $$
4. **Expectation Value:** If $\Psi$ is normalized,
   $$
   \langle \hat{A} \rangle = \int \Psi^* \hat{A} \Psi \, d\tau
   $$
   Example: position
   $$
   \langle \hat{x} \rangle = \int \Psi^* x \Psi \, d\tau
   $$
5. **Time Evolution:** The wavefunction evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:
   $$
   i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
   $$

### Working with the Hamiltonian Operator

The one-dimensional Hamiltonian:

$$
\hat{H}(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)
$$

where the first term is the kinetic energy operator and the second is the potential energy operator.

We assume **separation of variables**:

$$
\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x) f(t)
$$

Plugging into the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

$$
i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} [f(t) \psi(x)] = \hat{H} [f(t) \psi(x)]
$$

Recognizing that $f(t)$ has no spatial dependence and $\psi(x)$ has no time dependence:

$$
i \hbar \frac{df}{dt} \psi(x) = f(t) \hat{H} \psi(x)
$$

Divide both sides by $f(t)\psi(x)$:

$$
\frac{i \hbar}{f(t)} \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\hat{H} \psi}{\psi} = E
$$

where $E$ is a separation constant (the total energy). This yields **two separate equations**:

1. **Time-Dependent Equation:**

$$
i \hbar \frac{df}{dt} = E f(t) \quad \implies \quad f(t) = A e^{-i E t / \hbar}
$$

2. **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:**

$$
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
$$

**Full solution:**

$$
\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x) e^{-i E t / \hbar}
$$

### Born Interpretation of the Wavefunction

- $|\psi(x)|^2$ is the **probability density**, giving the probability of finding a particle between $x$ and $x + dx$:

$$
P(x) dx = |\psi(x)|^2 dx
$$

- **Stationary States:** The probability density is time-independent:

$$
|\Psi(x,t)|^2 = |\psi(x)|^2
$$

- **Time-Dependent Solutions (general):**

$$
\Psi(x,t) = \hat{T} \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar} \int_0^t \hat{H}(\vec{r},t') dt' \right) \Psi(0)
$$

## Dirac Notation

- **Bra:** $\langle \psi | = \psi^*$
- **Ket:** $|\psi\rangle = \psi$
- **Matrix Element:**

$$
\langle \psi_i | \hat{A} | \psi_j \rangle = \int \psi_i^* \hat{A} \psi_j \, d\tau
$$

- **Kronecker Delta:**

$$
\langle i | j \rangle = \delta_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1 & i = j \\
0 & i \neq j
\end{cases}
$$

Wavefunctions must be continuous, single-valued, and have continuous first derivatives. They must be **quadratically integrable** ($\langle \psi | \psi \rangle$ exists), except in the case of unbounded free particles.

### Example: Permutation Operator $\hat{P}_{ij}$

$$
\hat{P}_{ij}^2 = 1, \quad \hat{P}_{12} f = c f
$$

Applying the operator twice:

$$
\hat{P}_{12} \hat{P}_{12} f = \hat{P}_{12} (c f) = c^2 f = f \implies c = \pm 1
$$

### Pauli Principle

- **Fermions (half-integer spin):** The total wavefunction must be **antisymmetric** under particle exchange.
- **Bosons (integer spin):** The total wavefunction must be **symmetric** under particle exchange.

Example: For electrons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons.
