## Question 1:
Show that the eigenvalues of a Hermition operator are real numbers [6 pts]

## Question 2
Prove that wavefunctions corresponding to Different Eigenvalues of a Hermition operaotr are orthogonal [6 pts]

## Question 3:
The infrared spectrum of $^{75}$Br$^{19}$F consists of an intense line at 380 cm-1. Calculate the force constant of $^{75}$Br$^{19}$F. [6 pts]

## Question 4:
A particle of mass 2.00 E-26 g is in a one-dimensional box of length 4.00nm. Find the frequency and wavelenght of the photon emited when this particle goes from  the n = 3 level to the n = 2 level. [6 pts]

## Question 5:
Derive an expression for the number of translational states for a 3d ideal gas between $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon + \Delta \epsilon$. Approximatly how many states are there in a 1% band around $\epsilon$ (i.e. $\Delta \epsilon = 0.01\epsilon$) if you take $\epsilon = (3/2)kT$, T= 300K, m= 10E-25 kg, and box lenght a = 0.1m? What does this tell you about the distribution and degeneracy of translational states? [12 pts] 

## Question 6:
A sample of 325mg of neon occupies 2.00dm^3 at 20C. Use the perfect gas law to calculate the pressure. []4 pts

## Question 7:
A sample consisting of 2.00 mol of He is expanded isothermally at 0C from 5.00dm^3 to 20.0 dm^3
- (a): reversibly
- (b): against a constant external pressure equal to the final pressure of the gas
- (c): freely

For all three proscesses, calculate q, w, $\Delta$U and $\Delta$H. Assume ideal gas behavior. [12pts]
