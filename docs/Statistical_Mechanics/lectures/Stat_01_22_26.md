## Continuation of Review of Quantum Mechanics

### Non-interacting Particles
A system of two noninteracting particles can be described by the equation 

$$\hat{H}_{total} \Psi_{total} = E_{total} \Psi_{total}$$ 

where the total Hamiltonian is the sum of the individual Hamiltonians:

$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{H}_i = \hat{H}_1 + \hat{H}_2 + \ldots + \hat{H}_N
$$

$$
\Psi_{total} = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \psi_i = \psi_1 \psi_2 \ldots \psi_N
$$

If we plug these back into the Schrödinger equation, we get:

$$
(H_1 + H_2) \psi_1 \psi_2 = E_{total} \psi_1 \psi_2
$$

where we can see that $H_1$ will be multiplied by both $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, but $H_1$ only interacts with $\psi_1$, so we can bring the non-interacting $\psi$ out of the operator:

$$
\psi_2 H_1 \psi_1 + \psi_1 H_2 \psi_2 = E_{total} \psi_1 \psi_2
$$

Dividing both sides by $\psi_1 \psi_2$ gives:

$$
\frac{H_1 \psi_1}{\psi_1} + \frac{H_2 \psi_2}{\psi_2} = E_{total}
$$  

This shows that the total energy is just the sum of individual energies and the total Schrödinger equation is the sum of the two individual Schrödinger equations:

$$
H_1 \psi_1 = E_1 \psi_1
$$

$$  
H_2 \psi_2 = E_2 \psi_2
$$

We have effectively reduced **one noninteracting, two-particle equation** into **two, one-particle equations**. We can then get energies and wavefunctions by solving the individual eigenvalue problems and taking the sum/product of the results to get the total energy/wavefunction.

### Quantum Mechanics: Mechanical Modes

#### Particle in a Box:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2}
$$

with energies:

$$
E_n = \frac{h^2 n^2}{8 m a^2} 
$$

with n = 1,2,3,... (but not 0) and a = box length. 

#### Harmonic Oscillator:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2} kx^2
$$  

with energies:

$$
E_n = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega 
$$

with n = 0,1,2,3,... and $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$.

#### Rigid Rotor:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2 I} \left(\frac{1}{\sin{\theta}} \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin{\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\sin^2{\theta}}\frac{d^2}{d\phi^2}\right)
$$ 

with energies:

$$
E_J = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}
$$

where J = 0,1,2,3,... and $I = \mu d^2$ is the moment of inertia. 

--- 
Degeneracy:  
In the rigid rotor example, energy depends on J but $\psi$ depends on both J and m (where m is the z-component of angular momentum).  
Degenerate states are states with the same energy resulting from different quantum numbers. For a given J, m can take on values from -J to +J, resulting in a degeneracy of (2J + 1) for each energy level.

As particle number and model complexity increase, degeneracy becomes much more common. 

### Correspondence Principle

As quantum numbers increase, quantum mechanical results converge to classical mechanics expectations. For example, in the particle in a box model, as n becomes very large, the energy levels become very closely spaced, and the behavior of the particle approaches that of a classical particle moving freely within the box.

## Review of Thermodynamics:

System: the part of the universe under consideration  
Surroundings: the part of the universe outside the boundary  

Heat can be exchanged between the system and surroundings, or surroundings may do work on the system (and vice versa).

Kinds of systems:
- Isolated: No exchange of energy or matter
- Closed: Exchange of energy but not matter
- Open: Exchange of both energy and matter

To describe the state of a system, we need to know (for example) V, P, T, m, or amount of substance n.

Extensive Properties: depend on the amount of substance (V, m, n)  
Intensive Properties: do not depend on the amount of substance (P, T, density)

We can combine extensive properties to get intensive properties (density = m/V, molar volume = V/n).

Equilibrium is said to be a **definite state** with no fluctuations in macroscopic properties over time.

Many properties that we care about are **state variables**, which do not depend on the path taken to reach the state and therefore are not defined by their history. 

We can define the state of a system using state variables such as P, V, T, and n.

### Laws of Thermodynamics
- Zeroth Law: If system A is in thermal equilibrium with system B, and system B is in thermal equilibrium with system C, then system A is in thermal equilibrium with system C.
- First Law: Work is done to achieve motion against an opposing force. Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy can be transferred with heat when the energy change is a result of a temperature change. 

$$
\Delta U = q + w
$$

$$
dU = \not{d} q + \not{d} w
$$

where the bar through the d indicates an inexact differential, meaning that q and w are path functions and not state functions. U is a state function.

The total internal energy of an isolated system is constant.  
In a closed system dU > 0 → energy gained  
In a closed system dU < 0 → energy lost

State functions depend only on the current state of the system and not the path. 

$$
\int_a^b dU = U_b - U_a = \Delta U
$$

Because state functions are path independent, differentials are exact.  
q and w are path functions and their differentials are inexact.

Euler’s test for exact differentials:  
For a function f(x,y) with differential df = M dx + N dy, if 

$$
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
$$

then df is an exact differential.

- Second Law: In any spontaneous process, the total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases. For a reversible process, the total entropy remains constant.
    - dS > dq/T : Process is spontaneous and reversible 
    - dS = dq/T : Process is reversible (equilibrium)
    - dS < dq/T : Not possible  
In an isolated system dq = 0 and we get $\delta S > 0$

**The Fundamental Equation**

$$
dU = T dS - P dV + \mu dn
$$

This equation involves only exact differentials so it can be used at both equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. 

$$
dS = \frac{dU}{T} + \frac{PdV}{T}
$$

- Third Law: The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly zero. As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum.

If S > 0 at T = 0 K, then there is residual entropy from disorder in the system. 

### Enthalpy as an Example:

Entropy provides a criterion for spontaneity but it does not allow for calculations at constant T and V or T and P.

Internal energy $\Delta U = q + w$ can be re-written as: $\Delta U = q_p - PV$, which can further be rearranged to $\Delta U + P \Delta V = q_p$.

$\Delta U$ and $\Delta V$ are state variables so they can be written as differences (e.g., $U_2 - U_1$). Using this form we can recast our equation to:

$$
U_2 - U_1 + P(V_2 - V_1) = q_p = (U_2 + PV_2) - (U_1 + PV_1)
$$

It is now useful to define a quantity (Enthalpy) as

$$
H = U + PV
$$

This is a Legendre transform in disguise where we took U and transformed it to H.

$$
dH = dU + V dP + P dV
$$
$$
dU = dH - V dP - P dV
$$

Here we can recall the fundamental equation $dU = TdS-PdV$ and write

$$
dH = TdS + V dP
$$

where S and P are said to be the **natural variables** of enthalpy. 

Other thermodynamic potentials include:

Helmholtz Energy:  
$A = U - TS$, which is the Legendre transform of $dA = -PdV - SdT$

Gibbs Free Energy:  
$G = H - TS$, which is the Legendre transform of $dG = VdP - SdT$

**Why are natural variables important?**
- They can be held constant to determine spontaneity
- We can derive useful relations from them
- If we know a thermodynamic potential in terms of its natural variables, we can calculate all other variables and potentials. 

*Example:*  
Say we know Gibbs free energy, G, in terms of its natural variables (P and T), then we can solve for the exact differential for U:

$$
dU = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,n_i} dS + \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{S,n_i} dV 
$$

We can compare this to $dU = TdS -PdV$ and our knowledge of exact differentials to see that $T = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_V$ and $-P = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_S$

Analogous procedures can be followed to obtain:

| $T = (\frac{\partial H}{\partial S})_P$ | $-S = (\frac{\partial A}{\partial T})_V$ | $-S = (\frac{\partial G}{\partial T})_P$ |

| $V = (\frac{\partial H}{\partial P})_S$ | $-P = (\frac{\partial A}{\partial V})_T$ | $V = (\frac{\partial G}{\partial P})_T$ |

One reason we said natural variables are important is that we can derive useful relations, the so-called **Maxwell relations**:

From U:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_S = -\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial S}\right)_V
$$

From H:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_S = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)_P
$$ 

From A:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T
$$ 

From G:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = -\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_T
$$

In open systems we must account for "N" different species where $n_i$ is the amount of species i in the system. 

The differential for U now becomes 

$$
dU = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,n_j} dS + \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{S,n_j} dV + \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial n_i}\right)_{S, V, n_{j \neq i}} dn_i
$$

$$
dU = TdS - PdV + \sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i dn_i
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the **chemical potential** defined as 

$$
\mu_i = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial n_i}\right)_{S, V, n_{j \neq i}}
$$

$$
\mu_i = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial n_i}\right)_{S, P, n_{j \neq i}} = \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T, V, n_{j \neq i}} = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T, P, n_{j \neq i}}
$$
